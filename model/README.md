# NER Model

All NER models trained with SemClinBr are available in the [Hugging Faces repository](https://huggingface.co/pucpr/).

If the models were useful, we would love to receive a like ❤️

Also, we are making available our specialized model for the NER task that we trained with [PortugueseClinicalNER corpus](https://github.com/fabioacl/PortugueseClinicalNER).

Please download, unzip and follow the instructions on [this notebook](../ner_prediction.ipynb) to recognize clinical entities.
